\f0\fs24 \cf0 My assembler program is written in C language, if you want to compile a \'93.asm\'94 file into a \'93.hack\'94 file,  just run the command below:\
               \'93./\'85PATH/assembler filename.asm\'94\
then you will get the \'93.hack\'94 file in the same directory.\
To be honest, my ability of coding is not very good. However I love the course, so maybe my code is not very easy to read and not efficient, please just forgive it, I will do my best to complete the whole functions of the homework, although it is not easy for me.}
